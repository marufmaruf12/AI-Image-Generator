- Android Studio installed
- Git repository access

### Setup Steps

1. **Export to GitHub** (via Lovable interface)
2. **Clone and setup:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-github-repo-url>
   cd <your-project-name>
   npm install
   ```

3. **Initialize Capacitor:**
   ```bash
   npx cap init
   ```

4. **Add Android platform:**
   ```bash
   npx cap add android
   ```

5. **Build the web app:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Sync to Android:**
   ```bash
   npx cap sync android
   ```

7. **Open in Android Studio:**
   ```bash
   npx cap open android
   ```

8. **Build APK/AAB in Android Studio**

### Testing
- **Emulator:** Use Android Studio's emulator
- **Physical device:** Enable developer mode and USB debugging

## Performance Notes
- First generation may take longer as the AI model loads
- Subsequent generations are faster
- Images are stored locally on device
- No data sent to external servers

## Troubleshooting
- If build fails, ensure Android SDK is properly configured
- For WebGPU issues, the app automatically falls back to CPU processing
- Memory usage is optimized for mobile devices
